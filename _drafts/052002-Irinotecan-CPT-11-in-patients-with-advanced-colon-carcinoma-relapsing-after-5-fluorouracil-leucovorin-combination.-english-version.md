The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between performance status (PS) and mean dose of irinotecan (CPT-11) in patients with recurrent advanced colorectal cancer relapsing after 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin chemotherapy. Patients who had completed their last chemotherapy course with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for at least 6 weeks and progressed were included. Based on PS, we administered a starting dose of 250 mg/m(2) in patients with a PS 70-80 (group A), and 350 mg/m(2) for those with a PS > 80 (group B). Of a total of 90 treated patients, all were evaluable, 18 had a partial response (PR) (20%), 39 stable disease (43%), and 15 progressed (37%). No significant difference was noticed between patients with PS > or = 90 or < or  
= 80 (p = 0.925), or between those who received a mean dose of CPT-11 > or = 300 or < or = 300 (p = 0.602), for response, survival and time to progression. Toxicity was increased in group B as expected, with significant differences for acute cholinergic syndrome (p = 0.02), diarrhea after the first 24 h (p = 0.03) and severe diarrhea (p = 0.03). According to these results, we conclude that response to CPT-11 is independent of its dose, and that a dose of 250 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks might be a cost-effective and less toxic alternative in this setting. However, further adequately powered phase II or III randomized studies might be required in order to confirm this observation. Copyright 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel
