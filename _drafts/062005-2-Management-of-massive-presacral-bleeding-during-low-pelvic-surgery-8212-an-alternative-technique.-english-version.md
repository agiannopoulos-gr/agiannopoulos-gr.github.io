Although massive presacral bleeding during rectal mobilization is uncommon, it can rapidly destabilize a patient. So, effective hemostasis is critical in severe presacral hemorrhage due to the fatal course of this complication. Among the reported methods are packing, thumbtacks, inflatable devices, muscle tamponade, muscle fragment welding and application of endoscopic staplers. Local  
hemostatic agents in conjunction with other methods such as diathermy, cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives and application of bone wax are among other alternatives which may help to treat this serious complication. The aim of this study is to describe the anatomic and physiologic basis of our mode of treatment, which is new in the literature approach, treating two patients with presacral bleeding during low anterior resection for rectal cancer. The technique is the early clamping of the infrarenal aorta and suture ligation of the bleeding points from the presacral plexus.
